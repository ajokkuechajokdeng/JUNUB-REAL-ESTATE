3. **Domain & SSL**: Point your domain to the deployed services and set up SSL certificates.
4. **Environment Variables**: Set all sensitive keys and API URLs via environment variables in both frontend and backend.

## User Registration and Login

JUNUB Real Estate provides a role-based authentication system that allows users to register and login as either tenants or agents:

### User Registration

- Users can register through the `/api/users/register/` endpoint
- During registration, users must select a role (tenant or agent) using the `role` field
- Required fields for registration:
  - email
  - password
  - password2 (confirmation)
  - role (tenant or agent)
- Optional fields:
  - username (defaults to email if not provided)
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - phone_number
  - address
  - bio
  - profile_image

Example registration request for a tenant:
```json
{
  "email": "tenant@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "password2": "securepassword",
  "role": "tenant",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

Example registration request for an agent:
```json
{
  "email": "agent@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "password2": "securepassword",
  "role": "agent",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "phone_number": "1234567890",
  "company": "ABC Realty"
}
```

When a user registers with the 'agent' role, an Agent profile is automatically created for them.

### Automatic Role Detection Login

- Users can log in using the `/api/users/token/` endpoint
- The system automatically detects the user's role based on their profile
- The role is included in the token data, allowing the frontend to provide role-specific features
- Role-specific endpoints (`/api/users/tenant/login/` and `/api/users/agent/login/`) are still available for backward compatibility

Example login request:
```json
{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

The login response includes the user's role in the token data, which the frontend uses to determine which features to display:
```json
{
  "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "role": "tenant"  // or "agent"
}
```
