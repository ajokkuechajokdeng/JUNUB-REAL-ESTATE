## Deployment Plan
1. **Backend**: Deploy the Django backend to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean). Configure environment variables, allowed hosts, and use a production-ready database.
2. **Frontend**: Build the React app using `npm run build` and deploy the static files to a service like Vercel, Netlify, or serve them via Django.
3. **Domain & SSL**: Point your domain to the deployed services and set up SSL certificates.
4. **Environment Variables**: Set all sensitive keys and API URLs via environment variables in both frontend and backend.

---

## Notes
- To extend backend functionality, add models, serializers, and viewsets in the `realestate` app.
- The frontend supports multiple languages via the `public/locales` directory.
